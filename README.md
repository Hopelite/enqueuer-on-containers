# Enqueuer on Containers

The idea to make this repository was heavily inspired by the book ["Architecting Cloud Native .NET Applications for Azure"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/) and related [eShop](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop) repository.

The point of it is to separate monolith [Enqueuer](https://github.com/Hopelite/Enqueuer) application into multi-container app and thus practice the microservice and multi-container app development and hosting, applying some CI/CD practices.
